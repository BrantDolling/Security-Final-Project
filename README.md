# Security-Final-Project

Work in progress attempting to create a neural network to detect
FTP password guessing attacks.

## TODO

 - Create correct tensors from FTP log files.
 
 - Make new iterations work.
 
 - Create a function to determine accuracy. 
 
 - Repeatedly run and test.
 
## Observations/Issues

- If clusters do not overlap, works extremely well. 
If clusters do overlap, doesn't work at all.
